# SmartHotel - Web API and Frontend

This was my 2nd PHP project, I was learning using only vanilla features back then (2017)
The project uses MySQL for database features and "OneFramework" microframework for route handling and view rendering

## üèñ Overview

I wanted to create a POC for IoT implementation in hotels, as part of it I created a mobile app which guests can use to request services to the hotel staff and also have remote control of their room (turning on/off appliances and setting up the thermostat)

This project has a UI where users can manage room settings, create bookings and also monitor the room status with their sensors, this sensors are to monitor humidity, temperature and also light intensity values.

This was intended to be a remote monitoring solution to identify possible water leaks, high energy consumption and with it have a better insight to take actions.

## Features:

- Room management
- Guests management
- Room booking
- Some basic IoT support with Adafruit IO
